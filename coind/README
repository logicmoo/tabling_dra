This directory includes the following files:

colp.ecl:
        Load this to run colp_common.pl with Eclipse.

colp.pl:
        Load this to run colp_common.pl with Sicstus.

colpp.pl:
        Load this to run colp_common.pl with SWI Prolog.

colp_common.pl:
        A metainterpreter of "co-logic programming".
        The head comment explains how to use it.

colp_builtins.pl:
        This file contains declarations of built-in predicates that are
        allowed by the "colp" interpreter.  Support for many new predicates
        can be obtained simply by extending the table, but some may require
        special support from the interpreter.  In particular, addition of the
        cut would be non-trivial (and probably ill-advised).

translate_colp.pl:
        A translator that converts "co-logic programming" programs into
        straightforward logic programs.  The head comment explains how to use
        it.

example.clp:
        This trivial file illustrates the use of file inclusion (works both
        with the metainterpreter and with the translator).  It includes
        another file that contains the real example.

examples:
        Some examples of coinductive programs, all with the extension ".clp".
        Files with translated programs will have the extension ".pl".

original:
        A directory that contains a metainterpreter (and an example)
        almost exactly as they appeared in Luke Simon's Ph.D. thesis.
