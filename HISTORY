 2 Apr 2009 :  Version 0.9 (beta).

29 Apr 2009:   Corrected two errors, added earlier detection of completion.

11 Apr 2009:   "New style" coinduction.

16 Apr 2009:   - "New style" coinduction should not be the default, so
                 instead of ":- coinductive." and ":- coinductive2." we now
                 have ":- coinductive1." and ":- coinductive.", respectively.
               - Corrected a major error in the choice of data structures.

31 August 2009 (version 0.93 (beta)):
               - Various minor corrections, mostly cosmetic.
               - Making things acceptable to SWI Prolog:
                  1) Made the convention for partial application (as an
                     argument to apply/2) compatible with that of SWI Prolog,
                     which has apply/2 as a built-in.
                  2) Commented out mode declarations.
                  3) Renamed set_to_list/2 to list_from_set/2.
                  4) Some operators had to be put between parentheses.
                - Refactoring DRA files in order to facilitate porting to
                  SWI Prolog.
                - A version of DRA for SWI Prolog ("drap.pl").  The manual
                  was updated accordingly.
                - The process of porting to SWI Prolog uncovered an error in
                  DRA that did not manifest itself before only because both
                  Sicstus and Eclipse provide logical update semantics for
                  assert/1. The error is now fixed.
                - Avoided potential errors due to inadequate implementations
                  of variant/2 in the three Prolog systems (results are
                  undefined if the arguments share variables).
                - Addition of three examples by Brian W. DeVries. The
                  examples bring to light shortcomings of the current simple
                  LTL verifier.
                - Modified the LTL verifier to take care of one of these
                  examples (modification suggested by Brian W. DeVries).

4 September 2009 (version 0.94 (beta)):
                - Fixed a subtle error in the represantation of the some
                  tables in DRA (including the answer table).  The error
                  could lead to missing answers for programs that used
                  essence_hook/2.
                - Made the SWI Prolog version faster: examples/XSB/ham.tlp is
                  now 2.2 times slower than with Sicstus.  This was done by
                  more clever encoding of the data.
                - Made the SWI Prolog version even faster: it turns out using
                  the recorded data base is even more expensive than frequent
                  decompilation of clauses (especially for the auxiliary
                  data).  The code that uses the internal database is still
                  available, in case it should come in handy in future
                  porting efforts.
                - Used essence_hook/2 to make verifier.tlp run the difficult
                  examples due to Brian W. DeVries.

10 September 2009 (same version, i.e., 0.94 (beta))
                - The previous release was not good for cyclic terms, because
                  the new implementation of variant/2 did not handle them
                  correctly.  This has been fixed, but Eclipse essentially
                  cannot handle cyclic terms now.
                - SWI Prolog must use the recorded database if it is to handle
                  cyclic terms.  This makes it 2.5 times slower than Sicstus
                  on XSB/ham.

28 September 2009, version 0.95 (beta)
                - Take advantage of variant/2 in SWI Prolog (which is
                  correctly implemented since version 5.7.15).
                - Various small changes to bring DRA up on YAP.

30 November 2009, version 0.96 (beta):
                - Improved treatment of variants and instances (thanks to advice
                  by Ulrich Neumerkel).

 8 June 2010 (same version):
                - Fixed an error in clause checker (found by Abramo Bagnara).
                  Proper checking of singletons in DCG rules (not used in these
                  metainterpreters).  A few other minor improvements, not worth
                  bumping the version counter.

  April 2011 version 0.97 (beta):
                - A work around for the incorrect implementation of variant/2 in
                  SWI Prolog.
