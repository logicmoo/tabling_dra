%%%%%  Built-in predicates for the "dra" interpreter  %%%%

%%% If the interpreted program invokes a built-in predicate, that predicate must
%%% be declared in the table "builtin/1" below.
%%% Every addition should be considered carefully: some built-ins might require
%%% special treatment by the interpreter.

%%  NOTE: Just adding "!" won't do the trick, the main interpreter would
%%        have to be modified substantially.
