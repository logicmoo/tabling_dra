%%%                                                                          %%%

%%% The "set of coinductive hypotheses" contains those ancestors of the current
%%% goal that invoke coinductive predicates. It is used by solve/4, and factored
%%% out as an abstract data type to facilitate changing to a more efficient
%%% representation.
%%%
%%% The requirements are as follows:
%%%
%%%       (a) We must be able to check whether a coinductive goal G can be
%%%           unified with one of its ancestors.
%%%
%%%       (b) Ancestors that might be unifiable with G must be available in
%%%           reverse chronological order (i.e., the nearest ancestor first).
%%%
%%%       NOTE: Before checking for unifiability the goals must be passed
%%%             through essence_hook/2.
%%%
%%%
%%% The operations are:
%%%
%%%    empty_hypotheses( - stack of hypotheses ):
%%%         Create an empty stack for coinductive hypotheses.
%%%
%%%    push_coinductive( + goal, + stack of hypotheses , - new stack ):
%%%         Push the coinductive goal onto the stack.
%%%
%%%    unify_with_coinductive_ancestor( + goal, + stack of hypotheses ):
%%%         Fail if there is no unifiable coinductive ancestor on the stack. If
%%%         there is one, succeed after performing the unification with the
%%%         most recent such ancestor.  Upon failure undo the unification and
%%%         unify with the next such ancestor, and so on (in reverse
%%%         chronological order), failing after all unifiable ancestors are
%%%         exhausted.
