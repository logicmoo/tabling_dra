%%%  Last update: 27 March 2009.                                             %%%
%%%                                                                          %%%

%%% The "stack" is the chain of tabled ancestors used by solve/4.  It is
%%% factored out as an abstract data type to facilitate changing to a more
%%% efficient representation.
%%%
%%% The requirements are as follows:
%%%
%%%       (a) It must be possible to check whether a tabled goal G and one of
%%%           its ancestors are variants. There can be at most one such
%%%           ancestor, call it A.
%%%
%%%       (b) We must be able to identify the "current clause" that was used by
%%%           A and that led to the creation of G.
%%%
%%%       (c) We must be able to identify all the tabled goals that are
%%%           descendants of A and ancestors of G (i.e., all tabled goals
%%%           "between" G and A).
%%%
%%%       NOTE: Before checking for variance the goals must be passed
%%%             through essence_hook/2.
%%%
%%%
%%% Information about an ancestor goal is kept in the form of a triple:
%%%    triple( goal, index, clause )
%%% where
%%%    goal    is the (current instantiation of the) goal;
%%%    index   is the unique index of the goal;
%%%    clause  is the clause that is currently used by the goal (it has been
%%%               instantiated by matching with the goal in its original form,
%%%               but does not share variables with the goal).
%%%
%%%
%%% The operations are:
%%%
%%%    empty_stack( - stack ):
%%%            Create an empty stack.
%%%
%%%    push_tabled( + goal, + index, + clause, + stack, - new stack ):
%%%            where the first three arguments are the constitutive elements of
%%%            a triple.
%%%            Push the triple goal onto the stack.
%%%
%%%    is_variant_of_ancestor( + goal,
%%%                            + stack,
%%%                            - the triple with the variant ancestor,
%%%                            - goals between goal and the variant ancestor
%%%                          )
%%%         Succeed if the tabled goal is a variant of some goal in the stack.
%%%         If successful, return the first such member and the list of
%%%         intervening triples.


% %%--------------  The minimal implementation:  --------------%%
% %%
% %% The stack is just a list of triples.

%         !.


%%--------------  An implementation that uses goal_table:  --------------%%
%%
%% The goal table is used to speed up the check whether there is a variant
%% ancestor.  We still need a standard stack for getting the intermediate tabled
%% goals.  So the "stack" is represented by
%%    tstack( stack, goal table )
